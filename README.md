

We are participants in the World Robot Olympiad competition, Future Engineers category, our team

name is Aces 1672.

this is our code explain:

numbered loop for 12 times

restart gyro

loop color sensor for yellow and red

gyro switch inside the loop

if equal 0 go straight on till see yellow and red

if doesn't equal 0 gyro will be calculating the changes in the angle and input the value in the

mathematics calculator

the mathematics box will multiply it by -0.001

then it will send the results to the mini motor

then it will get out of the loop only if it sees yellow and red

stop for the main motor

then it will wait for one 1 second

reset gyro

reset medium motor

then it will enter a loop based on gyro sensor

the gyro sensor will calculate the angle of 90

when it is equal -90 it will end the loop

inside the loop, it will keep moving forward

motor a will rotate till the rotating will reaches -25 or more

loop ends

stop for motor a

wait for 1 second

it will calculate how much the motor a rotate so far

it will put it in the mathematics formula

it will multiply the results by -1

and then it will put the results into motor a





and then it will do all of these orders for 12 time

then the loop will stop

programming 2

we opened a variable named asr

we started the variable with 0

opened a reasonable loop

we opened a switch inside the loop

the switch is for the color sensor

if it is blue it will input the reading in a variable named dist

and it will put it in a mathematics formula

and it will add 1 for the results

and then the final results will be put in the variable dist

then end switch

if the results of the readings equal 12 then we will link it to the loop then we will end the loop

then stop

at the same time

restart for medium motor and gyro

walking forward on using gyro

then the gyro will calculate the rotation of the motor

if it is less than 0 it will multiply the result with 0.001

and it will put the results in the medium motor

and then it will do it over till it sees an object less than 20 cm

it will enter a switch

depend on the color sensor

if it is black it will rotate using gyro till it reaches -90 degree

then it will rotate how much the motor rotate

then it will make it straight

and if not black

go forward for 0.5 rotation





enter a switch depending on the color sensor

if green then it will restart the motor a

then turn till the gyro reach -45 degree

it will calculate how much the motor rotate

it will input the results into motor a then it will be able to go forward

if red restart the motor

till turn till the gyro reach -45 degree

it will calculate how much the motor rotate

it will input the results into motor a then it will be able to go forward
